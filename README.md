# Polarization Drift Data Processing

## Introduction
> The Polarization Drift Project at UMD's Britton Laboratory aims to quantify noise at various timescales within a 27km burried fiber optic cable, with the hope of making polarization-drift-correction more efficient for quantum networking and polarization-based communication schemes.
> Polarization data was recorded with the Thorlabs PAX1000 digital polarimeter. Measurements from this polarimeter tended to be [spaced non-uniformly in time](https://github.com/evanshaped/PAX-rate-visualization), complicating data analysis and making automatic data processing highly difficult.
> This repository contains programmatic tools written in python to pre-process and visualize PAX data, with some preliminary analysis functionality.
